The user is interacting with the client and client sends a request to server and server sends back a response. 
Api is responsible for that interaction between server and client

Now lets see 3 Tier or N Tier Architecture

The client is interacting with multiple servers. Servers are interacting together via Api.
Even DB is interacting with the server
This is called N tier Architecture
